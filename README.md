## Details
Query a web server to get the current and 5 day forecasted weather for a city. Using a server side API is important aspect of web programming and the openweather API is a good place to learn how to interact with a server side API. Figuring out how to get all the potential use out of the API took some time as each piece is not as simple as reading a single page. Finding out how to get the icons was a an important but more simplier once I figured out how to get it from the API itself and not from a different source.
